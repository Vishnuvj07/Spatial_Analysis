<h4> Case Study: The source of the 1854 cholera outbreak </h4>
We'll use modern Python tools to redo John Snow's analysis identifying the source of the 1854 cholera outbreak on London's Broad Street. In contrast to his Game of Thrones counterpart, London's John Snow did now something: the source of cholera. He learned it doing the first-ever geospatial analysis!

For this example, we'll use the data from Robin's blog. Robin did the work to digitize Snow's original map and data.
